I leveraged **PYTHON** to analyze the data and used **POWER BI** for creating Dashboards and Reporting to draw actionable insights and Recommendations.

**Objective:**
To analyze and gain insights from historical flight data, including departure and arrival times, delays, cancellations
and other relevant factors, to identify patterns, trends, and potential areas for improvement in airline operations. 
The project aims to utilize data-driven approaches to enhance flight punctuality, minimize delays, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize overall airline performance.


**Dataset Description:**
The flight data set contains essential columns providing details such as flight dates, airline information (name, DOT identifier, code), 
flight numbers, origin and destination airport codes, scheduled and actual departure/arrival times, departure and arrival delays, taxiing times,
wheels-off and wheels-on times, elapsed times, air times, distances traveled, and various delay reasons (carrier, weather, NAS, security, late aircraft arrival). 
Additionally, it includes indicators for flight cancellations and diversions, along with cancellation reasons when applicable. 
This dataset facilitates in-depth analysis of flight operations, performance metrics, delay factors, and overall operational efficiency.
